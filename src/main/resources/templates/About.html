    <p>
        The Student Management System (SMS) is a powerful platform designed to help schools and colleges manage student records efficiently.
        Administrators can add, edit, and delete student details with ease, keeping the database accurate and up-to-date.
        SMS improves workflow, reduces manual errors, and ensures quick access to student information across devices.
